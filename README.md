# [I Cecchini Del Mare](https://icecchinidelmare.herokuapp.com)

This website lets you share your current location through geolocation, and allows you to view the location of other users on a map, and chat with them.

I Cecchini Del Mare (Snipers of the Sea in Italian) or ICDM was made for the [Facebook group of the same name](https://www.facebook.com/groups/cecchinidelmare/). 

The idea is that spearfishers would use the website to find eachother and dive toghether or simply have a chat.

It's designed to be simple and lightweight, so once it's finished I won't add any more features, but I might continue development if there is enough demand.
